title: We're hiring Product Engineers (Ruby on Rails) at The Lookout Way
layout: post
---

Hi there, we're [The Lookout Way](https://thelookoutway.com/) and we make Lookout — a care management platform that powers aged care and NDIS service providers to get exceptional outcomes for their clients, families, and support workers.

[Our team](https://www.thelookoutway.com/meet-the-team) extracted Lookout from the digital infrastructure we made by running a real, world-class service provider, [Five Good Friends](https://www.fivegoodfriends.com.au/). Lookout has already powered over 1,000,000 hours of support in the home.

We're aiming for a start date in the next 4 months.

# About the job

You'll be working as a full-stack Ruby on Rails engineer on our platform known as Lookout. We structure our work around projects and you'll focus on one project at a time. You'll partner with another engineer and a designer to take a project from pitch through to production. The work is a blend of programming and collaboration on business problems giving you the control to balance delivery and trade-offs.

We roughly follow [ShapeUp](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook) so our projects and our projects are paced into [eight-week cycles](https://cycles.thelookoutway.net/). We spend the first six weeks designing and building. We spend the last two weeks tidying up and doing maintenance. Our pitches describe the outcome, not the how, so we lean on your empathy, prowess, and collaboration with the project team to get us there.

Supporting people to live well at home is broad so Lookout can be thought of as an integrated suite of tools to enable collaboration and remote monitoring in a client's home for themselves, their families, workers, and health professionals. To try and give you a better idea of Lookout and the work we do here are some recent examples:

- We built a feedback and broadcasting mechanism we call Must Dos and Should Knows. This mechanism keeps care teams looped in with each other through the CRM and the native apps. We've used this a lot during the pandemic.
- Transitioned our frontend from plain HTML/CSS over to ViewComponent and Tailwind CSS by replacing chunks at a time. We made heavy use of feature flagging to minimise changes to users.
- Made performance and bug fixes to open source projects we depend on.
- Used Datadog to narrow in on two of our slowest pages and refactored them to be speedy again.

You'll shape pieces of architecture on the backend with Ruby and you'll craft delightful interactions on the frontend with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a broad spectrum so we don't expect you to be deep at both ends. Instead, you'll be complemented by a team that's inclusive, kind, and flexible to help you learn and grow.

The web is at the heart of what we do. We take this philosophy through to our [native iOS](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/lookout/id1576631449) and [Android apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thelookoutapp.android&hl=en_AU&gl=US) too. They feel native, but they're a hybrid app built on top of the Turbolinks (Upgrading to [Turbo](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/) is on the cards!) native adapters.

Our tech stack and processes are:

- We have comprehensive tests and this allows us to do 30+ deploys a week through Buildkite
- We aim to ship software calmly and use processes that allow us to operationalise calm eg. we use zero down time migrations, static analysis to prevent security threats
- Heroku, Redis, Postgres, Datadog, Rails, TailwindCSS, StimulusJS, Turbo(links)

# About you

Shipping high-quality software lights your fire. You're a generalist at heart and you take pragmatic steps to move a project forward. You keep sight of the bigger picture, always working toward it and helping others see it too. You're a great writer and you like writing. Writing is the main way you think and share.

You believe in the collective ownership of the product. We celebrate the highs and we learn from the lows. We're kind, honest, and authentic with each other. We invite debate and we encourage alternative perspectives, but when we commit, we put our differences aside and we see it through. You are autonomous but love deeply collaborating such as pairing with other engineers, prototyping with designers, and exploring the business case with product managers.

You'll work remotely from anywhere in Australia as long as you have a solid internet connection and a comfortable setup. We're already in Perth, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane. We do have a COVID-safe office in the [Brisbane CBD](https://www.google.com/maps/place/179+N+Quay,+Brisbane+City+QLD+4000/@-27.4684525,153.0170302,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x6b915a06b7c2c29d:0xc2eedf160f982ed9!8m2!3d-27.4684525!4d153.0192189), but you won't be required to work from there, even after the pandemic.

We strongly encourage candidates of all different backgrounds and identities to apply. Each new person is an opportunity for us to bring a different perspective to the team. We are committed to building an inclusive workplace where you can do your best and most rewarding work. We anonymise and redact applications so they can be reviewed fairly.

You'll be working with vulnerable people so we require you to complete a National Police Check and the [NDIS Worker Orientation Module](https://www.ndiscommission.gov.au/node/1236). You must have the right to work in Australia.

# About our pay and perks

This is a permanent, full-time position and depending on your skills and experience we're prepared to offer you a salary up to $140,000 + 10% super, no matter where you live in Australia. You'll also get a $4,500 budget to pick your laptop, accessories, and display.

The way we work and the perks we offer are designed to help you live a fulfilling life. Some of us start late and some of us finish early. Some of us work in big blocks and some of us break it up. We overlap for most of the day and we work a regular week where overtime is a rarity. The work we do is meaningful and the problems we solve are interesting. We like coming to work and working together, but we're 20 people who are also parents, carers, siblings, friends, students, athletes, and hobbyists with a life away from work too.

You'll get the standard four weeks of paid annual leave and the customary ten days of paid carer's/sick leave. You’ll also get:

- Wellbeing allowance: An annual $500 wellbeing allowance to spend on anything that betters your life away from work
- Extra annual leave: +1 day of paid annual leave every year you are with us after your second year so you can take longer holidays.
- Paid superannuation on parental leave: We will continue to pay your super when you take unpaid parental leave as the primary caregiver so your super doesn’t miss out.
- Top up parental leave: We will pay the difference to your regular salary and parental leave from the Commonwealth Government for 4 weeks (+2 weeks every year you’re with us) if you’re the primary caregiver, or 2 weeks if you’re the non-primary caregiver.
- Employee assistance programme: You can get private and professional counselling at anytime.

# How to apply

Introduce yourself to our team by sending an email to [thelookoutway+ibnkfi@emails.readblindly.com](mailto:thelookoutway+ibnkfi@emails.readblindly.com). Tell us a bit about yourself and include your CV. Instead of a cover letter, we would love to hear your answers to these questions in the body of your email:

1. Why are you considering working at a product company and why now?
2. Would you consider yourself more of a backend person, more of a frontend person, or a mix of both? Where are you comfortable today and where would you like to learn and grow in the future?
3. You are working on a feature. You feel strongly developing it this way will get a better outcome, but your co-worker who is a Product Manager disagrees. What do you do next?
4. What do you think are the ingredients for building a high-quality web app? What does quality mean to you and how do you help maintain it over time? Can you share a proud or insightful moment with us as an example?

We put a premium on writing and we promise to give you our undivided attention. Your email will be anonymised and mentions of gender, nationality, languages, and places will be redacted so it can be read blindly and reviewed fairly.

We are hiring on a rolling basis which means we read applications as they come in. You'll first hear back from us within one week of applying and the successful candidates can expect to have an offer within three weeks of their application. Our hiring process is:

1. Send email to [thelookoutway+ibnkfi@emails.readblindly.com](mailto:thelookoutway+ibnkfi@emails.readblindly.com)
2. First interview to get acquainted and find alignment with your growth and our company. A video call with the CTO or Head of Engineering and one other member of the team.
3. Second interview to assess how well we collaborate. We will pair to understand business intentions and sketch a data model over a video call with an Engineering Manager
4. Offer, referee checks, and background checks.
5. [Start on a Thursday](https://tatey.com/2020/01/19/starting-a-new-job-on-a-thursday/)

We're grateful for your time and looking forward to hearing from you.
