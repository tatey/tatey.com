title: Obligatory Hello, World!

I've spent a good part of today on the seventh iteration of tatey.com.

1. Design
2. XHTML/CSS
3. Jekyllfy
4. About content
5. Generate and publish

It's generated by [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master), a blog-aware, static site generator in Ruby. Posts are in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and the source resides on [GitHub](http://github.com/tatey/tatey.com/tree/master), never to be lost again! Site conforms to the XHTML 1.0 and CSS 2.1 specifications. All pages are valid and semantic. If you find an error, [please let me know](mailto:tate@tatey.com).

Next step is to automate deployment.
