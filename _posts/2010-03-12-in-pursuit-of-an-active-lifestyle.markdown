Between work, study and personal interests I spend too many hours sitting in front of the computer. After recently buying a second hand [bicycle](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tatejohnson/4350545597/), I've been developing regular riding habits. Riding the bicycle to uni, instead of the motorobike. Riding the bicycle to the local shops, instead of the car. More importantly, I've been achieving a minimum of thirty minutes per day. Short, regular rides are refreshing and enable you to feel alive again. [Adii Rockstar](http://adiirockstar.com/2010/03/life-alignment/) feels the same about running.

On the 21st of March I'm participating in the [The Great Brisbane Bike Ride](http://www.bq.org.au/bike-week/program/the-great-brisbane-bike-ride/) (30KM) and looking forward to riding though the newly constructed [Clem Jones tunnel](http://www.clem7.com.au).
