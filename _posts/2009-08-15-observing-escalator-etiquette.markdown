title: Observing Escalator Etiquette
---

When using an escalator in Taiwan, you're expected to stand on the right unless you intend to pass quickly. It's a simple concept that everyone is already familiar with from driving (Taiwanese drive on the right). More importantly, observing escalator etiquette results in increased efficiency with large crowds. Casual commuters remain to one side of the escalator, allowing other commuters to pass  without hindrance. Escalator etiquette is win-win.

Since returning from Taiwan I have continued to observe escalator etiquette, even if it hasn't been adopted in this country. It's easy, you ought to observe it too.
