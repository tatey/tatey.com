The lime you see on tatey.com today is the result of continued evolution from the previous six years. Let us take a look back at where it all started.

Cartoony and 3D with a subtle texture created by the noise filter. Shadow is inconsistent with lighting. Used a combination of circles, gradients and the free transform tool to create a 3D appearance.

Removed texture and decreased prominence of the shadow in pursuit of a simpler appearance.
